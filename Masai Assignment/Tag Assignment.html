        <!-- <b>Bold Tag</b> -->
        <h1>BOLD Tag</h1>
         <p>The b HTML element is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance. This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface

        <h3>Example</h3>
         <p>The two most popular science courses offered by the school are <b class="term">chemistry</b> (the study of chemicals
            and the composition of substances) and <b class="term">physics</b> (the study of the nature and properties of matter
            and energy).
